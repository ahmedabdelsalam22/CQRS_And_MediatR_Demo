# CQRS And MediatR implementation

# CQRS and MediatR Demo

This repository contains an implementation of the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern using MediatR. 

## Introduction
CQRS is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of an application into two distinct models: the Command model for write operations and the Query model for read operations. This separation allows for better scalability, performance, and maintainability of the application.

## Getting Started
To get started with this demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository using the following command:
   ````
   git clone https://github.com/ahmedabdelsalam22/CQRS__MediatR_Demo.git
   ```

2. Open the solution file `CQRS And MediatR implementation.sln` in your preferred IDE.

3. Explore the codebase to understand the implementation of CQRS using MediatR.

## Features
This demo showcases the following features:

- Command and Query separation: The application follows the CQRS pattern, separating write and read operations.
- MediatR integration: MediatR is used as a mediator to handle commands and queries.
- Command and Query handlers: The application contains separate handlers for commands and queries.
- Request and Response models: Each command and query has its own request and response models.
- In-memory data storage: The demo uses in-memory data storage for simplicity.

## Usage
To use this demo, you can leverage the implemented commands and queries or create your own based on your application requirements. The following steps outline how to use the existing commands and queries:

1. Modify the existing command and query models or create new ones according to your needs.

2. Implement the corresponding command and query handlers by inheriting from the `IRequestHandler` interface provided by MediatR.

3. Register the command and query handlers in the dependency injection container.

4. Use MediatR to send commands and queries to the appropriate handlers.
